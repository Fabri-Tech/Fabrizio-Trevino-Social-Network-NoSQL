# Fabrizio Trevi√±o NoSQLSocial Network API

This project is a challenge to build an API for a social network web application using a NoSQL database. The API allows users to share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. The technologies used include Express.js for routing, MongoDB for the database, and Mongoose as the ODM (Object Data Modeling) tool.
